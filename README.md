Crowdfunding_ETL

Project desription
For the ETL mini project, you will work in a group to practise building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

This was completed in a group of three: Drishti Patel, Rahul Gade and Puja Tiwari. We ensured collaboration and communication while working on different parts of the project and final completion.
